# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.3.3/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the proguardFiles
# directive in build.gradle.

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# pdfbox-android: keep the text extraction path; reflection is used for
# font/stream handlers and R8 strips them without this.
